To Whom It May Concern,
My name is __Susan Brown_______ and I have an active medical insurance policy with
your company. The policy number is _2218_______. I am writing this letter to
claim reimbursement for $79.20 for a custom crown provided by Smiley Boutique,
who is an in-network provider for UltraCo Insurance.
Enclosed with this letter are the following supporting documents for your reference and
review:
I am including the previous EOB that UltraCo says under the SpecialDentalPlus plan
that Smiley Boutique is not a network provider. I am also including a copy of the
UltraCo website page that lists Smiley Boutique as an in-network provider.
According to section __15.2__ of the policy, I am entitled to __80__% reimbursement.
Kindly acknowledge the receiving of this claim and advise whether I have to fill some
form or whether you require other documents to complete the claim request.
Looking forward to your response and cooperation.
Sincerely,
__Susan Brown_______________
